# Explore TaskCarry with a sample project

[简体中文](TESTER_START.zh-CN.md) · [User manual](en/windows-example.md)

The [user manual](en/windows-example.md) is the recommended way to connect your project. If you prefer to see the workflow first, use this optional walkthrough with fictional files in a separate directory. You do not need to provide private project data or become a software tester.

Download **taskcarry-0.2.0rc5-product.zip** from the [release page](https://github.com/bryan123466/taskcarry/releases/tag/v0.2.0rc5). Give the extracted package and a new example directory to a Codex chat.

## A prompt you can use

> Read README.md and docs/en/windows-example.md from this TaskCarry package. Help me explore it in **[a new example directory]**, using fictional material only. Keep my existing projects and user-level configuration unchanged.
>
> Use the manual to prepare the governance directory and an isolated Python environment. Check the package version and show what was installed. Create a small fictional project with two task workspaces and a receiving baseline.
>
> In one workspace, save an unfinished task checkpoint and a continuation note. In the other, prepare and offer one useful stage, review its receiving plan, and bring it into the shared project. Show how the paused task remains available without becoming a new delivery obligation. If helpful, demonstrate a second cumulative stage with an explicit relationship to the first.
>
> Show the current project state and next steps here in this chat. Explain what was saved, what was received, and what is still only a plan. Reuse the completed receiving result when checked again. If demonstrating a workspace update or checkpoint restore, review the plan and preserve existing files; restore only into a new directory.
>
> Start with the available CLI. If I want MCP and this host supports it, show the required configuration and confirm the connection with an actual tool call after the necessary host approval. Report a live host connection separately from successful local commands. Do not create schedules, push to a remote, deploy, or read another project's files.

## What you should see

The same chat should explain where the task records and example files were saved, which stage joined the project, and how to continue the unfinished task. TaskCarry does not open a separate reporting application. In everyday use, your governance AI produces project summaries from the tools and records; scheduling is an optional host configuration.

A sample involving forms simply uses document files as a fictional deliverable. It is not a measure of AI-agent quality, and you can use another small example.

If you want to share feedback, describe the step that helped or confused you. A [sanitized issue](../templates/defect-report.md) is welcome, but it is not required to use TaskCarry. Fault injection and developer regression tests belong in disposable synthetic test projects, not your working project.
