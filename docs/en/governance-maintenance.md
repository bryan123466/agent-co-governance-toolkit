# Keep governance current while work continues

[简体中文](../zh-CN/governance-maintenance.md) · [繁體中文](../zh-TW/governance-maintenance.md)

TaskCarry keeps project records in the control directory while the installed toolkit provides the operations that use them. Updating the toolkit should help the next session continue the same work. It should not create a new project, resubmit past results, or merge business branches simply to refresh a Skill.

This supplement applies to 0.2.0rc5. The existing installation and operating walkthroughs remain applicable. Start a new project with the normal walkthrough; the arrangements below help maintain an existing installation. For saved schedules and an optional observer, see [scheduled governance](automation.md).

## Three updates with different purposes

| What changes | How to use it |
|---|---|
| Toolkit and project Skills | Install the chosen wheel in the dedicated runtime, preview project setup, then install the managed integration files. Keep the existing control state. |
| Shared project progress | Read `status` or `agenda` from the same control directory. Reading progress does not require changing a worker's Git branch. |
| Accepted code or deliverables needed by a worker | Use an explicit `adopt` plan. This is a business/code update and keeps its existing conflict and WIP checks. |

## Start a governance turn with current work

`agenda` gives the existing AI a limited selection of unfinished operations, submitted stages, and artifacts needing a decision. Paused or waiting tasks stay recorded without becoming extra deliveries. Completed history remains available through the full status and records.

```json
{"limit": 20}
```

Send this to `taskcarry_agenda`, or use the CLI `agenda` action with a JSON request file. Follow `next_cursor` to inspect remaining pages. A cursor belongs to the same current-input fingerprint; if work changes, start a fresh selection. Pass the previous `fingerprint` as `previous_fingerprint` when comparing observations. `changed: false` does not close pending work or authorize another attempt.

Selection does not perform a repair, run another AI, or start a schedule. Matching experience is a suggestion; the existing executor must still verify actual effects. An indexed store selects current records and required predecessors without loading unrelated completed history. The item limit bounds the response, not all current-input processing, query time or the duration of an AI session.

## Maintain the current-work index

New projects create the derived index automatically. An older or invalidated index leaves the original records intact: `agenda` falls back to a full selection and reports `storage.upgrade_required`. After installing the chosen toolkit version and safely stopping affected governance writers, use the explicit `upgrade` action on the existing control directory:

```sh
python -m taskcarry --project ./control upgrade
```

Use the actual existing control path; do not initialize a replacement. The action rebuilds only the derived index, in one transaction, and is safe to repeat. Original records and events remain unchanged. Confirm `storage.mode` is `indexed_current_v1` and `storage.upgrade_required` is false afterward. This is not a package updater or a migration of business files. An older client writing records can invalidate the index again; retire that writer before rebuilding it.

## Preserve reviewed evidence and a run's exact scope

When authorized host tools supply relevant evidence, `observe` records its source reference, reviewed revision, registered task/workspace and explicit stage or artifact relationships. Repeating the same observation reuses it; a changed observation requires the previous revision so stale information cannot overwrite newer evidence. The record does not fetch a chat, establish source truth or grant access. Preserve a source reference rather than copying sensitive conversation content.

For a round with selected work, `run` starts a record with named stages, operations and relevant observations. Finishing it checks the recorded terminal states of that selection. It reports unresolved objects and changed observations without replaying the operations or silently adding later work to the original scope. Verify actual effects through the corresponding operation tools first; a run result summarizes those records, not an independent Git audit. New work and the project's overall state remain separate from the selected result.

See [the evolution report](governance-evolution.md) for the reasoning and focused synthetic checks behind these changes.

## Resume an interrupted installation

Before upgrading, inspect current receiving work and pending adoptions. `reconcile` accepts a planning `limit` (default 20, maximum 100), selecting unfinished receiving operations before new stages. Their identities enter the frozen plan. Plan completion covers its selection; later deliveries remain pending and are reported separately. An agenda page does not define execution scope.

An adoption preparation failure retains its error and checkpoint for the next agenda. Once the conflict is addressed, a successful successor can explicitly supersede it while preserving the original failure. Do not erase journals or retry unchanged conflicts. `refresh_plan` offers planning advice for proven no-effect operations; it does not execute a replacement. `verify_and_finalize` lets the receiving executor verify an existing effect and finish its receipt.

Setup saves an exact installation intent before changing managed files. If it stops after writing a file but before recording the result, repeating the same install can recognize that effect and finish the record. Files that have already reached the expected state do not need to be rewritten.

If you have edited a managed file, or selected a different candidate while an installation is pending, setup preserves the evidence and reports the conflict. Keep the pending record and use the original candidate to diagnose or resume; deleting metadata is not a recovery method. Unmanaged files are not adopted merely because they happen to match a packaged file.

While setup is changing its managed files, avoid editing those same files in another application. Its lock coordinates setup operations; it does not lock every external editor.

## Confirm which version is actually running

A historical source snapshot describes what was used then; a current runtime observation or adoption receipt describes what is used now. Preserve both when software changes. This release does not import arbitrary legacy identifiers or discover every native chat.

`doctor.runtime` reports the package version, interpreter and module location imported by the process answering the request, together with managed setup information. A successful CLI check does not prove a previously opened MCP process has reloaded. After deliberately updating its configuration or restarting that connection, check through that connection too.

Source fingerprints describe the files currently on disk. They do not prove that a long-running process has replaced previously imported code. Restart the affected MCP connection after changing the runtime package; `loaded_code_verified` remains false rather than asserting in-memory code attestation.

For TaskCarry's own development, run governance from an installed wheel outside the editable source checkout. Develop and test the next version separately. Adopt it when the affected operations are safely stopped. Keep the control directory: tasks, checkpoints and previous receipts belong to the project, not a particular toolkit build. This release does not include a general automatic package upgrader or a cross-schema rollback engine.

## One governance chat, separate repository scopes

One control store still has one receiving baseline. A product with two independent repositories can use two control stores and one common project overview maintained by its governance chat. Give each MCP connection an explicit distinct `server_name` during setup, for example `product_core` and `product_app`; subsequent setup calls retain the chosen name.

```json
{"mode": "preview", "server_name": "product_core"}
```

After reviewing the result, use `mode: install` with the same name. The generated fragment still requires deliberate host configuration; it is not activated automatically. Do not assign two control stores to write the same receiver. This arrangement does not create a shared multi-repository transaction or a cross-computer lock.

The same issue found by a local governance turn and by a user report should remain one product change. Fix the shared implementation once, validate it, then record which installations adopted it. A note about a fix and the installed fix are different parts of that work.
