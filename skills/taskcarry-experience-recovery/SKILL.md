# Conditional recovery / 条件经验恢复

Start with the current error code, operation journal and actual Git/file effects. If an effect already happened, preserve that fact and repair only missing bookkeeping. Do not infer absence from a missing receipt, erase old evidence, or repeat the complete workflow.

TaskCarry's experience rules are data, not shell programs. `verify_and_finalize` lets the receiving executor verify an already-applied Git effect and finish its receipt. `refresh_plan` is planning advice: where a saved operation proves that no effect was applied and has no candidate or stash, the agenda can return a structured `plan_request` with `execute: false`. It never silently replaces or executes a plan. Review the original failure and changed conditions, request the new plan, then review its exact scope before execution. Bind rules to the observed code and operation; add task scope when the evidence is task-specific. Enabled/version checks and applicability must hold before use.

For receipt recovery, repeat the original bounded governance call so the engine verifies effects and uses an applicable rule. Inspect the returned experience-use and completion evidence. A matching rule, or reading its suggestion, is not proof of a repair. If the effect cannot be established or the condition changed, retain the actionable issue and identify the missing fact. Repeating an unchanged preparation failure is not progress; resolve its concrete conflict or retain its next condition. Do not discard the journal to restart a transaction.

Unknown defects can produce a candidate fix and synthetic regression scenario within authorized development scope. Validate the initial failure, the corrected outcome, replay safety and a negative non-applicable case before proposing a public rule/tool update. Never experiment on a user's live unrelated task. Record whether only scripts, simulated clients or an actual AI/host integration were tested.

For a defect that needs continuing maintenance, use `taskcarry_issue` with a stable condition fingerprint, then `taskcarry_fix` to link the tested fix, version and evidence references. A changed condition reopens review; closing an issue requires a reviewed resolution reference and cannot close an unfinished Git operation. Identical records are reused. The fix result compares actual project setup and disk fingerprints; an installed version match still does not prove that another running host process reloaded it. A shared fix belongs in the tool or Skill release so future work can prevent the failure, not only repair it repeatedly. `taskcarry_upgrade` repairs the derived current-work index for an older store; it does not upgrade the package, install Skills, or change business branches.
